- a client-server program for calculating determinate and matrix transpose.
- The client side asks the user to enter the matrix. Then ask the user which operation he wants: 1-transpose, 2-Determinate.
- The server supports the two services, each service at a different port.
- After the client sends the requests it sleeps for a random number
- The server is able to handle both services simultaneously.
- The transpose of the matrix  is printed in the matrix format.
- it is able to handle several clients for both services at the same time.
